# My Experience and Learning

Throughout the development of the Hamster Squeakify Chrome extension, I learned various aspects of creating and publishing a browser extension, and utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to manipulate web content. 

I learned about the structure and components of a Chrome extension, such as the manifest.json file, content scripts, background scripts, and browser actions. I became familiar with different manifest versions and the changes required to work with the latest version (v2 to v3).

I learned how to define the extension's basic information, permissions, icons, and content scripts within the manifest.json file.

I gained experience in creating content scripts that can manipulate the DOM of a webpage. Specifically, I learned how to replace the text content of a webpage with hamster squeaks and restore the original text.

I learned how to create a popup UI for the extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This involved designing a visually appealing interface, adding interactive elements like buttons, and implementing event listeners for user interactions.

I learned how to communicate between the popup and content scripts using Chrome's message passing system. This allowed me to trigger the squeakifying and unsqueakifying of a webpage based on user interactions within the popup.

I used VSCode for the first time on this project, and linked it to my GitHub.  I used Git to track my changes and push them to the remote repository.

Throughout the project, I encountered various issues, such as errors with the manifest file, content script injection, and message passing. By resolving these issues, I honed my debugging and problem-solving skills.

Enjoy the squeaks! üêπ
